# ABCU

## üìù Project Overview
This project supports the Computer Science department at ABCU by providing a simple course advising tool. The application:
Reads course data from a .csv file.
Loads it into a vector data structure.
Displays all courses in alphanumeric order.
Allows the user to search for a specific course and view its prerequisites.
Alongside the implementation, this project includes an analysis comparing hash tables, binary search trees (BSTs), and vectors as data structures for storing and searching course data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
Import Course Data: Load from CSV file into vector of Course objects.
Search: Find and display a specific course by course number.
Sort and Display: View all courses in alphanumeric order using selection sort.
Validate Prerequisites: Ensures listed prerequisites exist in the dataset.

## üõ† How to Run

1. **Clone or download** the project files.

2. **Ensure your CSV file is correctly formatted** and update the file path in `ProjectOne.cpp`:

   ```cpp
   inFS.open("C:\\Path\\To\\CS300_ABCU_CourseList.csv");
3. Compile the project:
    ```cpp
   g++ ProjectOne.cpp -o advising_tool
5. Run the application:
    ```cpp
   ./advising_tool

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary goal of this project was to build an advising tool for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The program reads course data from a CSV file, stores the information into a vector data structure, and allows users to either search for a course or view all courses in alphanumeric order. 

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by carefully considering the size and structure of the dataset. Since the course list was small, I chose to use a vector to store course data. Vectors are simple to implement and efficient for linear operations when working with small datasets. Understanding data structures was crucial because it allowed me to evaluate trade-offs: while hash tables and binary search trees offer faster search times for larger datasets, their overhead and complexity weren't justified for this case. The vector‚Äôs straightforward behavior made it an ideal choice for this advising tool.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One challenge I encountered was validating the prerequisites to ensure that each one existed within the dataset. This required cross-referencing the prerequisites of a course against all available courses. I solved this by implementing a validatePrerequisite function that iterates through the course list and confirms whether a given prerequisite is valid. 

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working with vectors, validation checks, and user input highlighted the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. I started using more meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and inline comments to explain my logic.
